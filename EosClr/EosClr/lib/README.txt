This library requires the EDSDK (Canon's SDK for their cameras). In order to get it, you need to register at their website.

To do this, go to the support website:

http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer

Select your camera, go to the Drivers & Software section, expand the SDK section and click on the link contained there. For example, for my Rebel T3i, the link is:

http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/eos_slr_camera_systems/eos_digital_slr_cameras/eos_rebel_t3i_body?fileURL=ps_sdk_form&dojo.preventCache=1432696464944&inTabView=false&id=0901e02480057a74_1&productOverviewCid=0901e024802aa218&pageKeyCode=downloadLicense&keycode=Sdk_Lic

Follow the directions contained in that request form and wait for them to give you access. From there, download the SDK and copy all of the headers and library files into this directory.

Do not commit any of those files, because they don't seem to be redistributable.
